                <br>Welcome to the IP Addressing page!<br>
                <p>Each host in a network, including in a subnet, needs an IP address. However, each subnet needs its own IP address as well.</p>
                <p>This division is accounted for by the use of a subnet mask. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, so a subnet mask determines how many bits are used for the subnet and
                how many are used for the individual hosts. This is formatted like <samp>#.#.#.#/#</samp>, with the last number being the mask; this is the number of bits used for the subnet. Thus,
                32 - the mask is the number of bits used for the hosts. The mask should be picked based on the number of hosts that the network is expected to contain; a higher mask
                means fewer hosts.</p>
