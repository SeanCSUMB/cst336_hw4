                <br>Welcome to the Switches page!<br>
                <p>In order to transmit data between the hosts in a subnet, just the IP addresses may not be enough; network switches instead help get the job done!</p>
                <p>Switches help route data between hosts within a subnet. They should not be confused with routers. When it recieves data, a switch uses a forwarding table to
                convey the data to the correct port. Routers work with MAC addresses instead of IP addresses. They also ensure that only the correct host receives the data.</p>
